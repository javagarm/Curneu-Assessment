               Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people
 through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is preventable and curable.
 In 2018, there were an estimated 228 million cases of malaria worldwide.
 The estimated number of malaria deaths stood at 405 000 in 2018.

## Observing all the graphs, the following conclusions can be drawn
# For all the regions, except Afirca, the cases are declining yearly. Africa shows a steady decrease, but not a huge decrease
